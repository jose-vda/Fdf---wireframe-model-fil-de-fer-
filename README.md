FDF is a project from 42 School that introduces you to 3D graphics and visualization in C.
The goal is to create a program that reads a 3D map from a file and displays it as a wireframe (3D grid) in 2D, allowing for rotations, zooming, and movement.

This project teaches you how to:

Work with graphics libraries like MiniLibX.

Apply mathematical concepts such as matrix transformations, rotations, and projections.

Handle user input to interact with graphics in real time.

Manage dynamic memory, structures, and rendering pipelines efficiently.

By the end, youâ€™ll have a program that can visualize 3D landscapes, manipulate them interactively, and showcase your understanding of mathematics and computer graphics.
